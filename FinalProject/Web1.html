                <b>But why a Calculator?</b>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Since a calculator is a basic standard for many coding programs. It helps the programmer get a good grasp on how to work the math of a new programming language. In this case
                    it was Javascript. Creating this calculator also told me how to overcome some hard obstacles, such as being able to use the same buttons to fill two different number values.
                    Also I needed to have a 'fake' number value to display itself on the calculator screen, and then I used two real number values that were behind the screen math processed by
                    Javascript. Lastly, I had to figure out how to let the user continously calculate after they had an answer. Either way, I finally made this calculator, so enjoy the use of this useless calculator.

                <b>Purpose of this Calculator</b>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The same purpose of every single other calculator that you probably have and have utilized: to calculate numbers. So what else did you think the calculator was for? Thought there was
                    some easter egg? Well no, there isn't one. I would be too lazy to make on anyways. So enjoy using this calculator to calculate numbers. Numbers that can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
                    9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, to 1.7976931348623157e+308 since Javascript can't even comprehend what infinity is. Do we know what infinity is? It may not be even a real thing,
                    rather just a phenomenon that occurs as time passes and increases an intergral value. Perhaps inifnity can't be reached, but just an idea describing the growth of values. Maybe it's time.
                    Maybe time is just energy, because if all energy stopped transferring, nothing would ever happen. No heartbeats, no burning of fuel in stars, super novas would be frozen, light would stop moving.
                    So time is just the description of energy change, I guess. Anyways, this is a huge tangent, so lets just say, use the calculator to calculate calculatable numbers that you want to calculate.

                <b>Design of the Calculator</b>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I used some Flexbox with CSS, but it does turn out that the space around each button is quite wide. Not sure how to fix that, but the calculator
                    will do for now. I do wish flexbox could give you an option to change spacing of 'space-around' and 'space between', but hey, it's still very powerful
                    and does basically what you imagine it would do. I also added box-shadows to each button to make it look 3D when pressed. Oh, and the button colors changed
                    too, they look much more snazzy than just gray *cough cough* "grey".

                <br>
                <p>
                    Isn't this just the purpose of the calculator? I guess not, since purpose is my intended use of this JANK calculator, but I guess you can come up with something.
                    Maybe use it to count, maybe try to make words out of the number, maybe find the easter egg, maybe to just calculate with this terrible calculator if you somehow
                    feel like calculating with it. But either way, I don't know what you can do with the calculator, as long as you can press the buttons and decide what to do with
                    the numbers on the screen.
