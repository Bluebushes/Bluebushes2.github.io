                    A little fun sentence generator so you can make some fun little sentences. I do not want to stay up all night typing useless
                    text that no one in my presentation will probably read. So, I'm just going to copy and paste some odd descriptions of things out on here. So here goes, I was once eating a
                    bottle of water and I don't know what to type here as filler text. Here is the purpose of this generator so I don't know type text random gibberish so I can copy this in. I do not want to stay up all night typing useless
